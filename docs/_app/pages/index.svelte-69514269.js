1)	Integrative physician in active practice helping patients connect with their deep body wisdom (marrying the mind, body and spirit) for healing. (see my book BodyWise)
2)	Deep soul calling to connect humans to the reality that we ARE the body nature we are destroying with global warming, endocrine toxicity, pollution, and species extermination\u2026 and healing the rift between the body-mind, and humans-nature is essential in this process. (looking for opportunities to engage in this work in a deeper way)
3)	Leader in Integrative Health care on Equity, Racism, Cultural Appropriation, interprofessional bias, and Global outreach and cooperation. Am on the board of the Academy for Integrative Health and Medicine, where I founded the BIPOC committee which has done extensive work in this area. Developing a Heal the Healer program for mixed health professionals (MD, DO, RN, DC, Lac, nutrition, PT, pharmacy, indigenous healers)\u2014all impacted by the current, sad state of health care in the U.S. and abroad.

4)	An expert on relationship and sexuality (5 books published in this area). Married and with my husband for 34 years.
