<h1 class="svelte-11b491h">Andrew Maxwell Mangino</h1>
<p class="blurb svelte-11b491h">Dreamcrafter. Co-founder. Taoist. Runner. Italian-Jew.</p>
<p class="eyebrow svelte-11b491h">ABOUT</p>
<p class="blurb svelte-11b491h">Andrew is the CEO of the Office of American Possibilities, a studio for launching moonshots that harness the passion and ingenuity of the American people to solve intractable national crises in the spirit of pragmatic idealism and common purpose. OAP projects include Welcome.US, the nation’s leading platform for inspiring and empowering the American people to support refugees as they resettle here (launched with the Obamas, Bushes, Carters, and Clintons after the fall of Kabul and expanded after the Russian invasion of Ukraine); UNITE, a national media project for healing our Civil War-level divisions; More Perfect, a forthcoming national campaign to align the country around Sustainable Democracy Goals; Covid Collaborative, the largest cross-sector platform for fighting the pandemic; Just.Us, a forthcoming national effort to address the inequitable distribution of lawyers to citizens requiring civil legal aid and public defenders; and Dream Together, a national challenge to inspire every-day Americans to join with others across divides to solve problems. He is also the co-founder and co-chair of The Future Project, a national non-profit that inspires young people to discover their purpose and learn how to change the world. Its flagship project emerging from the pandemic is Future Coach, a mobile-based personal guidance system to support young people – especially those without easy access to opportunity – to build the life and world of their dreams through thousands of videos that expose them to possibilities for their future and on-demand guidance, 24/7/365 personal text-based coaching, and access to tangible opportunities that help advance their dreams. Andrew graduated from Yale, where he served as editor of the Yale Daily News, and attended Oxford as a Marshall Scholar to study social innovation and the psychology of inspiration. He then worked with Bill Drayton, the founder of Ashoka, to explore the future of social entrepreneurship – and served as a speechwriter to Attorney General Eric Holder and then Vice President Joe Biden. He loves running, reading, Taoism, and – above all – the music of the film composer John Williams!</p>

<p class="eyebrow svelte-11b491h">ABOUT</p>
<p class="blurb svelte-11b491h">An educator, storyteller, and nerd whisperer across multiple continents, Courtney has spent the last ~10 years at X, Alphabet&#39;s &quot;moonshot factory&quot; (formerly known as Google X), as an architect of its unique culture of radical creativity. She and her team launched X’s most iconic moonshots, from self-driving cars to stratospheric internet-beaming balloons to Google Glass, helping “the future” make contact with “the real world.” On the way, she’s been a coach to hundreds of entrepreneurs and engineers and helped identify and describe the habits and mindsets that are suited to the mission of long-term, high-risk innovation. Now she’s bottling and sharing these methods and insights inside and outside of X as a founder of X&#39;s 10X Accelerator.  Prior to her adventures with moonshots, Courtney built many foundations of Google’s global communications and public affairs team, working on nearly every Google product area and in many corners of the world, including stints in Asia and Australia/New Zealand. The common theme across her career: scrappy, startuppy, creative environments with sci-fi-sounding science/tech, high stakes, and only the haziest sense of what the path ahead might hold.</p>

<p class="blurb svelte-11b491h">Laila Tarraf is a human resources executive with over 25 years of experience building teams and advising companies across many industries and stages of growth. She was a founding member of Walmart.com at the height of the first internet bubble, and the Chief People Officer at Peet&#39;s Coffee and Tea as it was redefining its values as a national brand. She then spent seven years working in private equity as the Director of Human Capital at GI Partners and a Human Capital Advisor with Altamont Capital. Over the past three years, she served as the Chief People Officer for Allbirds, as the company navigated a global pandemic, broad social unrest while building the talent infrastructure needed for the company to go public. She currently serves as an Advisor for Allbirds, and is an executive coach working individually and collectively with senior executives who are ready to lead in a more conscious, integrated way as we all explore a new way of working post-pandemic. Over the years, through professional achievements and personal accomplishments alongside professional setbacks and personal tragedies, Laila has evolved her leadership and life philosophy into one that embraces the inherent duality of life -- balancing courage with compassion, integrating head with heart, infusing power with tenderness. Her journey and hard-won insights are what she shares in her debut book, Strong Like Water. Laila is a graduate of the Berkeley Haas School of Business and is also a guest lecturer at Berkeley Law School. She is Lebanese and American, an avid traveler and world explorer, and a proud mom to her teenage daughter, Nadia and her 8-pound Yorkie, Max.</p>

She runs the award-winning Santa Cruz Integrative Medicine Clinic and has been voted “Best Doctor” in Santa Cruz County every year, from 2009-2022.

<p class="eyebrow svelte-11b491h">CREATIONS, PASSIONS, PROJECTS, AND ENDEAVORS</p>
<p class="blurb svelte-11b491h">All of my work flows from the fundamental learning that we are not separate from &quot;nature&quot;, nor from each other. My work clusters in these areas:
1)	Integrative physician in active practice helping patients connect with their deep body wisdom (marrying the mind, body and spirit) for healing. (see my book BodyWise)
2)	Deep soul calling to connect humans to the reality that we ARE the body nature we are destroying with global warming, endocrine toxicity, pollution, and species extermination… and healing the rift between the body-mind, and humans-nature is essential in this process. (looking for opportunities to engage in this work in a deeper way)
3)	Leader in Integrative Health care on Equity, Racism, Cultural Appropriation, interprofessional bias, and Global outreach and cooperation. Am on the board of the Academy for Integrative Health and Medicine, where I founded the BIPOC committee which has done extensive work in this area. Developing a Heal the Healer program for mixed health professionals (MD, DO, RN, DC, Lac, nutrition, PT, pharmacy, indigenous healers)—all impacted by the current, sad state of health care in the U.S. and abroad. Actively  partnering with policy and healthcare providers globally, to create a healthcare model that respects and includes indigenous healers and practices, focuses on health prevention and is available to all.
4)	An expert on relationship and sexuality (5 books published in this area). Married and with my husband for 34 years. Am interested in relationship as a crucible for personal growth and finding that “tension between the opposites” of how we are separate and yet intimately connected at once. The “taboo” nature of sexuality in our culture is symptomatic of the deep divide between mind and body in our consciousness. My belief that the more embodied and in touch with our pleasure we are… the more vital, joyful, and effective we are at making change in the world. Our sexual energy (jing qi) is the most potent part of our life energy (qi)—why wouldn’t we want to tap it for our health and thriving? Been leading workshops on this all over the world for 20 years.</p>
